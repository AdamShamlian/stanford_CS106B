Homework solutions to Stanford's CS106B coursework from SEE

These are some prospective solutions to the aforementioned class' homework. 
As a quick note, the included files are most often those I have written myself
(in some cases starting with a template provided courtesy of Stanford instructors). 
In most cases, code that is not explicitly mine SHOULD be marked as Stanford's, but
in the likely event that I fail to exhaustively accomplish this, you should assume
anything in this repo belongs to Stanford.

Additionally, on the subject of posting homework solutions, this is entirely an 
exercise in the world of Git and CPP. If you are a student, I encourage you to work 
through the exercises without consultation to this repo. [See Stanford's Honor Code.](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/student-conduct-process/honor-code-and-fundamental-standard)
In fact, I cannot guarantee that the solutions provided here are in what would be deemed a 
complete form. [See the disclaimer and license.]()

Moreover, I will gladly remove the repo in the event that this strictly 
violates any Stanford policies, however, given the open nature of this particular course, 
I would be inclined to leave it up if at all possible.
